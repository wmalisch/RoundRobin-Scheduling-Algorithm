/*
##  Round-Robin Scheduling Algorithm  ##

	Parameters:-

	queue: 1D int array containing the CPU burst time for every process in a ready queue
	np: number of processes (length of `queue` array)
	tq: time quantum for the RR algorithm


	Returns:-

	rr_result struct pointer, where
	rr_result -> order: 1D int array, containing the execution order of processes (i.e. `(rr_result -> order)[0]` is the process number of the first process)
		** hint: p1 is always the first item in order of selection in round-robin and FCFS
    rr_result -> order_n: int, representing the size of the `order` array, described above ^
	rr_result -> turnarounds: 1D int array, containing the turnaround time for each process (i.e. `(rr_result -> turnarounds)[0]` is the turnaround time for p1)
